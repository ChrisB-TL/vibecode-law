## Submission Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Submission

Gather the following information:

**Required**
- Project name
- A single sentence tag line
- Longer description (what it does, why you built it)
- Key features
- Help needed, if any
- Relevant practice areas
- Screenshots
- Video demo link, if you have one.
- Link to try it (if publicly available)

**Recommended**
- What AI tools/platforms you used to build it
- Time invested (roughly)
- Lessons learned
- GitHub repo (if open source)

### Step 2: Submit via Our Form

Go to our [Submission Form](/showcase/create), and complete it.

### Step 3: Moderation Review

Our volunteer moderators will review your submission. We check for:

- **Not spam** - Is this a genuine project?
- **Appropriate content** - Does it comply with our [Community Guidelines](/legal/community-guidelines)?
- **Minimum viability** - Is there something to see/try?

We are **not** evaluating:
- Code quality
- Security and compliance
- Commercial viability
- Feature completeness
- Whether we personally like it

If it's a genuine legal tech project that follows our guidelines, it gets approved.

### Step 4: Notification

You'll receive an email when your project is approved (or if we need more information).

Typical review time: **1-3 business days**

We're volunteers, so please be patient during busy periods.

### Step 5: Share!

Once approved, your project is live on vibecode.law. Now spread the word:

**LinkedIn** - The legal tech community is active on LinkedIn. Share your project with your network:

> "I built [project name] to solve [problem]. Created it in [timeframe] using [AI tools]. Check it out on @vibecode.law [link]"

**Legal tech communities** - Share in relevant Slack groups, Discord servers, and forums.

**Your firm/organisation** - Let colleagues know what you've built.

## Tips for a Great Submission

### Write a Clear Description

Tell us:
- What problem does it solve?
- Who is it for?
- How does it work?

Avoid jargon. Be specific.

**Good**: "Calculates litigation deadlines under the Civil Procedure Rules. Enter a triggering event, select the deadline rule, and get the date - adjusted for weekends and court holidays."

**Less Good**: "A comprehensive deadline management solution leveraging AI to optimise legal workflows."

### Show, Don't Just Tell

Screenshots matter. Show the interface in action. A 30-second demo video is even better.

### Be Honest About Limitations

If it's a prototype, say so. If it only works for one jurisdiction, mention that. The community values honesty.

### Credit AI Assistance

Part of what makes vibecode.law interesting is seeing what can be built with AI tools. Share:
- What platforms/tools you used
- How long it took
- What worked and what didn't

## After Approval

### Engage with Feedback

Community members may comment on your project. Engage constructively. Thank people for feedback. Consider their suggestions.

### Update Your Listing

Ship an update? Add new features? You can edit your listing to keep it current.

### Build on Success

One project often leads to another. Use feedback and lessons learned to improve or build something new.
