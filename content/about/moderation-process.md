# The Moderation Process

All showcases go through a moderation process before they are published. 

## Our Moderation Team

Our current moderators are a group of **law firm partners, legal tech founders, and legal innovation enthusiasts** who volunteer their time to keep vibecode.law running.

They come from diverse backgrounds:

- **Practising lawyers** who build tools to solve problems in their own work
- **Legal tech entrepreneurs** building companies at the intersection of law and technology
- **Legal operations professionals** driving innovation within law firms and legal departments
- **Legal technologists** with deep expertise in both law and software development

What unites them: a belief that lawyers who understand technology will shape the future of law, and a commitment to making that future accessible to everyone.

## What Moderators Do

### Review Submissions

When you submit a project, a moderator reviews it to ensure:
- It's a genuine project (not spam)
- It complies with our [Community Guidelines](/legal/community-guidelines)
- The submission is complete enough to be useful to the community

**We don't judge quality or commercial potential.** If it's a real legal tech project, it gets approved.

### Maintain Community Standards

Moderators enforce the [Community Guidelines](/legal/community-guidelines), including:
- Removing content that violates our guidelines
- Addressing reported concerns
- Issuing warnings or taking action against bad actors

## Our Approach

### Light Touch

We believe in minimal intervention. The community largely self-regulates. We step in when needed, not before.

### Transparency

When we take moderation action, we explain why. Our rules are public. Our processes are clear.

### Fairness

Everyone is held to the same standards. We don't favour projects from people we know.

### Responsiveness

We aim to review submissions within 1-3 business days and respond to reports promptly. Our moderators are volunteers with day jobs, so we appreciate your patience.
